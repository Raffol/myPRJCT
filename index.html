        <p>
          I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful <br>
          design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,<br>
          creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. <br>

          Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at Klaviyo, specializing in accessibility.<br>
          I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI components that power Klaviyo’s frontend,<br>
          ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive<br>
          user experience.<br>

          In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — <br>
          from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios. <br>
          Additionally, I also released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners through <br>
          building a web app with the Spotify API.<br>

          In my spare time, I’m usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around <br>
