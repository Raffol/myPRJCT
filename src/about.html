        I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful <br>
        design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,<br>
        creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. <br>

        Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at Klaviyo, specializing in accessibility.<br>
        I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI components that power Klaviyo’s frontend,<br>
        ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive<br>
        user experience.<br>

        In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — <br>
        from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios. <br>
        Additionally, I also released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners through <br>
        building a web app with the Spotify API.<br>

        In my spare time, I’m usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around <br>
